Hi there! 

Thank you for subscribing to GreenToGo in our inaugural year of operations! It really does take a village to reduce our environmental impact, and we’re grateful that you’ve been helping us toward this mission! Collectively, we’ve averted 1,500+ containers from the landfill since we launched with just 5 participating restaurants last July! Now with 25 restaurants and nearly 500 subscribers, we expect our impact to grow exponentially in the coming months and years! 

*This is a reminder that your subscription is expiring soon! We hope that you’ll renew your subscription and continue using GreenToGo to prevent more landfill-bound trash in our community.*

*To renew, please take the following actions:*

1) Login to your account here: https://app.durhamgreentogo.com/subscriptions/
2) Go to “My Subscriptions” 
3) If you see the button “Add a Credit Card” this means we do not have payment information on file for you and therefor cannot automatically renew your subscription.  Click that button and follow the instructions to add a credit card to your account.  

As long as you take these steps before {{ expire }} you will have no interruption to your GreenToGo service. If you miss that deadline, not to worry! You can still login to your account, so follow steps 1 & 2 above, and then choose “add a new subscription.” This will reactivate your account and establish auto renew for the future. 

We so appreciate your contributions to our program and would love your feedback. THIS SHORT SURVEY (https://goo.gl/forms/IwpZsyDZIkvlSuCa2) will help us gather the information we need to continue to improve our operations in year 2 of GreenToGo. We appreciate you taking just a few minutes to complete it. 

With Gratitude,
The GreenToGo Team
